# SE-Assignment2

## Project Description
This assignment was part of my coursework for CINS 5318, Software Engineering. This project simulates a collaborative development workflow using Git and GitHub. It demonstrates branching, conflict resolution, and documentation practices in a software engineering context.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SE-assignment2.git
   cd SE-assignment2
2. Make sure Python is installed:
  on your Terminal enter:
  python --version
3. Run the script:
   on your terminal enter:
   python hello.py

 ## Usage Examples
 When you run the script, you should see output like:
 Hello, World!
 Hi Alabi - resolved greeting

## Branching Workflow
main: Original and final version of the script

feature-1: Added a personalized greeting

feature-2: Simulated a conflict with main by editing the same line

## Conflict Resolution Summary
In feature-2, I edited the same line of code that was changed in main. When I tried to merge the branches, Git detected a conflict. I resolved it manually in VS Code by choosing a final version of the greeting and committing the fix. This helped me understand how Git handles conflicting changes and how to resolve them properly.
