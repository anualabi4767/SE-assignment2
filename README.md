# SE-Assignment2

## Project Description
This project was part of my Software Engineering assignment for CINS 5318. I used Git and GitHub to manage a simple Python script while practicing real development workflows like branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. I created multiple branches that edited the same line of code to trigger a merge conflict, then resolved it manually using VS Code. I also tracked tasks using GitHub Issues and documented everything clearly in the README. The goal was to get hands-on experience with version control and understand how collaboration works in real coding environments.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SE-assignment2.git
   cd SE-assignment2
2. Make sure Python is installed on your Terminal enter:
    ```bash
    python --version
3. Run the script, on your terminal enter:
    ```bash
    python hello.py

 ## Usage Examples
 When you run the script, you should see output like:
 
 Hello, World!
 Hi Alabi - resolved greeting

## Branching Workflow
main: Original and final version of the script

feature-1: Added a personalized greeting

feature-2: Simulated a conflict with main by editing the same line

## Conflict Resolution Summary
In feature-2, I edited the same line of code that was changed in main. When I tried to merge the branches, Git detected a conflict. I resolved it manually in VS Code by choosing a final version of the greeting and committing the fix. This helped me understand how Git handles conflicting changes and how to resolve them properly.

## GitHub Issues
Issue #1:Update README with installation and usage instructions (assigned to me)

Status: ✅ Closed

Issue #2: Review conflict resolution steps (assigned to my Tolulope Ogunmakinwa)

Status: ✅ Closed

Both issues were created, tracked, and closed using GitHub Issues.
